# text-to-binary-to-image-converter


The project takes data from a text file and converts it to binary format. This binary data is then converted to an image where black pixels represent 0 and white pixels represent 1. The resulting image can be used to visually represent the binary data in a compact and easily shareable form. The project uses Python and its libraries such as NumPy and OpenCV to perform the conversion of text to binary and image creation. The resulting image can be saved as a file for future use or sharing. This project has potential applications in areas such as data encryption, image steganography, and information hiding.
